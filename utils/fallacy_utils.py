Segment: For Trump, that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the <rogue kingdom'>s despotic leader.

Segment: In fact, there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly. As noted above, at this point literally every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities and then regurgitated by the mainstream media <cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation> until proven otherwise. And if Paddock really did act alone and this evidence is some sort of mistake, there is surely video footage proving so.",

Segment: The few bishops with sufficient spine to stand up to the pressure of both Rome and their own national conferences  newly empowered with directives to make doctrinal declarations  will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration. <A dark, impenetrable and irreversible winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall.> Not being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual time bombs, ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors.",

Segment: For those heavy into it, that's their thing, but it ain't my thing, he said. <The people who talk about the \"Jewish question\" are generally anti-Semites.> Somehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism.",

Segment: One way or another, the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit. <Either the human element of the Church will act according to the means which seem possible, however extraordinary, or Heaven itself will intervene> in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement due to the negligence of time-serving pastors who left their sheep completely undefended against the wolves who preyed upon them, including the wolf the cardinals improvidently elected Pope. Some four months before Archbishop Vigan's testimony Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk, the Archbishop of Utrecht, Netherlands, perhaps the most liberal territory in the entire Church, protested that Bergoglio's blatant nod to intercommunion with Protestants in Germany means that the bishops and, above all, the Successor of Peter fail to maintain and transmit faithfully and in unity the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture and that the situation reminds him of Article 675 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which refers to the Church's final trial before the Second Coming, that will shake the faith of many believers [a] mystery of iniquity' in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth.",

Segment: Maybe he should have taken the time to look to the founding forefathers and that document which they drew up called The Declaration of Independence.
