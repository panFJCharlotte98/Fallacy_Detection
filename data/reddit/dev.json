Still, I'm a little mixed on the topic and I think we often talk about it wrong. Sometimes people talk like a match will result in an arrest but that isn't rational. It is more likely it would be used as a way to get a lead. For instance, if I am a cop and have a video of someone robbing an old lady at an ATM and run it through a program to facial match, I get out a list of potential people. From there I go investigate those people and maybe it helps me find the bad guy (or maybe not). Of course they would need more evidence than just a match to get an arrest but it is a start.

Science can (in theory at least) tell us where to build roads that maximise efficiency, but it can\u2019t tell us whether efficiency is a worthwhile goal.

It might be obvious to you that certain goals are good to strive for, but disagreements on what goals to strive for is why we have different political parties in democracies to begin with.

It's when people learn new mechanics that not many bother to learn or use. When people find ways to put themselves in an advantage and should definitely not be removed. It's a competitive game, which means it's hard to become better than others and if you really want to become better then you can learn ways to be a better player. I would understand for console players, since they can't do this flip. But saying that you don't want it in the game because it's hard to do and some people will put in the hours to learn it therefore you're at a disadvantage is not our problem. That is your problem. It's like saying I don't want to put in the hours to learn how to pick up small boost and some people do put in that time therefore they will have more boost control over me, please get rid of boost or make unlimited boost. Do you realise how stupid it sounds? So please keep your problems to yourself.\nComment Reply: Read my comment man i can already do it i just dont agree with it. Its not a newly discovered mechanic that has been possible since the beginning of the game like a half flip has.

This article suggests that an ideological undercurrent tied to the organic movement and environmental rights groups, combined with a shift in beekeeping economics is the source of untrue claims with regard to neonics.\nComment Reply: I believe the data speak for themselves regarding the alleged profound negative impact of neonics. Since the data show no problem with honeybee populations that strongly suggests no issue. Of course the counter will be that that somehow it is wild/native bees which are being affected. That seems unlikely because domestic bees are more likely to be around agriculture/neonics. However, wild/native bees are not livestock so it could be that beekeepers undo the damage but only to honey bees.
