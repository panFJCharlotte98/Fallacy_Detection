Also depends what scenario we're talking about here.   Like in terms of the government being able to gain access to, say, your emails if they suspect you of something then i think that's true. The government doesn't care about your personal emails, you only need to worry if you're doing something illegal. If that could help fight terrorism then you can see why people think it's a necessary evil.   On the other hand however it does give the government an insane amount of power. Say the government became tyrranical and extremely restrictive, them being able to access your emails enables them to do this. However you could also argue that if the government decided to be tyrranical, they'd access them anyway - they just either wouldn't tell the people or wouldn't ask them about it.   So yeah I'm on the fence really.\nComment Reply: Ya the the thing is <if we give the government access theyll know they can so they keep taking more and more> Thats one of the arguments against gun laws, if we give them a foot theyll take a mile",

Turning water into a commodity is a very slippery slope. Better to just stop buying the bottled water and let Nestle do its thing.

All essential public infrastructure is operating just fine.   The level of over the top dramatic hyperbole to this is sad.

However, Respawn also isn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed either. Some of their decisions and lack of fixes for things like audio is just baffling. As for solos, if Overwatch can have FFA despite being a team oriented game with heroes having different abilities, then Respawn can have solos. So their excuses don't make any sense.\nComment Reply: I'm not trying to defend Respawn here, but why is it that everyone on reddit always has the answer? <They have a ton of data telling them way more than whatever people are yelling about here>. Sure there might a vocal majority (or minority in reality) on reddit wanting solos, but what if their data doesnt support it? What if a tiny percent of the playerbase actually played solo when it was available. What if those who are most vocal are just a very small minorty of players. <More than likely they have so much information from every one of us playing the game that they probably have a good idea about what they are doing>.

You don't think we have? Repeatedly?\nComment Reply: Read the post. I did show it to be true. Not in excruciating detail, <but just by appealing to all of the towering intellects throughout history and up until the present that have accepted some religion as true>. And I am sure some atheists have engaged with the arguments Im talking about, but many of them have not. Just look at Stephen Fry and his Big Think interview. He thinks saying why is there so much evil in the world is a knockdown objection to the existence of God, when its only the beginning of a discussion that has been going on for thousands of years and can be traced back to Deuteronomy.",

It has been shown to make men more sexually aggressive, dissatisfied with their own sex lives, and contributes to the global sex trade. Viewing porn also causes prolonged dopamine exposure, which the brain will build resistance against - making it more difficult to feel joy from other daily activities. Porn is also highly addictive, and has diminishing returns over time, so a user will have to watch more porn, or more extreme porn, to get the same amount of dopamine.

Partly it may also be that these are stories that primarily affect women. The majority of the time, women are the victims. Theres something to be said for putting yourself in the victims shoes and trying to understand your \u201cpredator\u201d. Every woman has been in a situation that started the same way as these murders do: walking down an alley at night, dates with a stranger, an acquaintance who latches on a bit too quickly, a charming man flirts with you at the bar, etc. I think there\u2019s something primal in realizing hey, that could have been be. But maybe if you learn as much as you can and look for patterns, you can protect yourself.\nComment Reply: Yeah, <but I really haven't seen a lot of men mentioning it to me in private or otherwise either>. And it sure as hell isn't because I talk with guys in socially acceptable circles. Any imageboard, forum, whatever where everyone just says anything on their mind, I never see any great amount of men expressing their secret interest in serial killers or the sort of morbid things women do. All I see is racism, misanthropy or muh-soggy-knee, and the only ones talking about serial killers are those who adore them, usually either Breivik or Elliot (Whereas women with a serial killer interest tend to be fascinated more with the 'classic' kinds, American Psycho style) So social acceptance can't be it.",

I was due for an upgrade (leaving blackberry Tour) in May and was anxious for the iPhone 5 to come out so I could finally get the latest and greatest but I was let down when fall brought me a marginally improved 4s. Of course, the 5 has potential to be a game-changer, but I am also worried about the iPad 3. New chip, better screen, and siri are the main expected improvements (obviously speculation) but Apple's latest products have not been completely unmatched like they had in the past.  But for the average consumer, it is hard to question that Apple is best one can get.\nComment Reply: <The average consumer doesn't care about specs. They don't care if the body changes.

Siri makes keeping your to do lists and alarms much easier> and it answers random facts from wolfram and does google searches faster than typing them in (when it's working) again another problem solved. Unsurprisingly apple can't sell these things faster. People on reddit aren't regular users.

No, something better is needed from which to argue.   &gt;TLDR  &gt;If the Holy Spirit exists, Christianity is true. &gt;The Holy Spirit exists. &gt;Therefore, Christianity is true.  You start by trying to provide evidence of the Holy Spirit, but end with trying to legitimize Christianity as truth.

It broke my heart. And he was flippant and dismissive.   The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings\nComment Reply: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. https: //www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/04/05/amid-new-talk-of-criminalizing-abortion-research-shows-dangers-for-women/ Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin.

Oddly enough, the logic of physicalism entails and requires the existence of unprovable metaphysical substances, the very thing most physicalists want to deny.  That physicalism is persuasive doesn't surprise me. I can understand its appeal by \"everyday\" rationalists who would rather not think in detail about philosophical issues: its straightforward and pretty unproblematic (again, unless you stop to think about it). But I find it very odd that anyone who takes philosophy or psychology seriously would hold to such a clumsy view.\nComment Reply: <Since so many philosophers do tend towards physicalism, perhaps you should consider that it's not so clumsy a view>.

I do not agree that there should be a flag or that MAPs should be included in the acronym, but it is a real condition that needs people to seek help. There is a difference between a child molester and, to use the crude word, pedophile. We should not accept them for who they are, because it is deviant and dangerous if their desires become actualized, but we should not stigmatize them either. Fear of being stigmatized like this only leads people with these feelings to not seek help, only increasing the chances that they may become perpetrators. These people need help, not hate and stigmatization.\nComment Reply: <Having sex with children was the norm for thousands of years>.

Based on my experience 20% seems to be the norm now.   Personally, I only tip 15% if the service was distinctly mediocre. For good service (i.e. prompt, friendly, handled any mistakes appropriately, etc) I always tip 20% or more. If the service was excellent or I\u2019m a regular at the place, I tip 25% to 50% depending on the amount of the bill. If the bill is cheap (like under $10) I leave a flat $5 - why should I only pay $1.50 for someone to take care of me when I would receive the same level of service if I\u2019d ordered more expensive items?   Going out to eat is not a frugal behavior in the first place. If it\u2019s something you want to do, budget for it and enjoy yourself, but don\u2019t try to save money by under tipping your server. It is hard work and we live off of tips.\nComment Reply: Ah the old, \" if you can't afford to tip well, you shouldn't go out to eat \" gambit.

Dish soap today, such as Dawn, doesn't contain the same type of chemicals (such as lye) as it did 100 years ago when you were not supposed to use soap on cast iron. In fact it would be more accurate to say that today's dish soap is really dish detergent. Feel free to use if you want. Full disclosure, <I don't use soap on my cast iron.
