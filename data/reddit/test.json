Still, I'm a little mixed on the topic and I think we often talk about it wrong. Sometimes people talk like a match will result in an arrest but that isn't rational. It is more likely it would be used as a way to get a lead. For instance, if I am a cop and have a video of someone robbing an old lady at an ATM and run it through a program to facial match, I get out a list of potential people. From there I go investigate those people and maybe it helps me find the bad guy (or maybe not). Of course they would need more evidence than just a match to get an arrest but it is a start.

Science can (in theory at least) tell us where to build roads that maximise efficiency, but it can\u2019t tell us whether efficiency is a worthwhile goal.

It might be obvious to you that certain goals are good to strive for, but disagreements on what goals to strive for is why we have different political parties in democracies to begin with.

It's when people learn new mechanics that not many bother to learn or use. When people find ways to put themselves in an advantage and should definitely not be removed. It's a competitive game, which means it's hard to become better than others and if you really want to become better then you can learn ways to be a better player. I would understand for console players, since they can't do this flip. But saying that you don't want it in the game because it's hard to do and some people will put in the hours to learn it therefore you're at a disadvantage is not our problem. That is your problem. It's like saying I don't want to put in the hours to learn how to pick up small boost and some people do put in that time therefore they will have more boost control over me, please get rid of boost or make unlimited boost. Do you realise how stupid it sounds? So please keep your problems to yourself.\nComment Reply: Read my comment man i can already do it i just dont agree with it. Its not a newly discovered mechanic that has been possible since the beginning of the game like a half flip has.

This article suggests that an ideological undercurrent tied to the organic movement and environmental rights groups, combined with a shift in beekeeping economics is the source of untrue claims with regard to neonics.\nComment Reply: I believe the data speak for themselves regarding the alleged profound negative impact of neonics. Since the data show no problem with honeybee populations that strongly suggests no issue. Of course the counter will be that that somehow it is wild/native bees which are being affected. That seems unlikely because domestic bees are more likely to be around agriculture/neonics. However, wild/native bees are not livestock so it could be that beekeepers undo the damage but only to honey bees.

Humans are by and large the only species on this planet who not only love, but also care for the weak (promise I don't mean that in a bad way). Lions don't have a support group to prop up one of them that is injured or gets a thorn in their paw. They say \" fuck em \" and leave them to fix it themselves, or die. Humans are beautiful *because* we shield, care for, and protect the outliers of our family/society.

Ever since our little Industrial Revolution. <We have gone against the grain so badly that natural selection barely applies to us anymore>. We are too far removed from nature and are no longer a true part of it, <were more liken to a disease> that just consumes resources in massive quantities, leaving everything else to suffer the consequences. We do not deserve to be here, so refusing to breed and add to the population is what we do. Human extinction would be the best thing for this planet and its arrogant not to take a broader look at what weve done to the ONLY planet we have to live on and realize the same thing. Once Earth is gone, thats it. We are not going to find some other inhabitable planet with the exact same conditions as this one. And even if we did, why the fuck should we be allowed to spread to that one like a virus and start to consume from that one too?",

Most states have laws against carry while drinking.  Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right.  14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval.\nComment Reply: Yeah its not just about my approval, <pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR>. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

The answers are a lot more disturbing than I ever thought.  &gt;According to published scientific studies, compiled by the HRA, tests involving baboons at the RPA included: the testing of radioactive material on four baboons; a blood pressure study involving 109 baboons as part of research into the effects of hypertension in pregnancy; a study involving nine baboons where researchers attempted to induce preeclampsia, which resulted in the death of one mother and one baby baboon; and a study on shoulder injuries which involved the surgical cutting of the shoulder tendons of eight baboons that were then euthanised to allow post-mortem study of the healing process.  &gt;The most controversial study involved the transplant of pig organs into baboons.
