Description	Vaccines pose a risk of death to the elderly.
Evaluation Emotional	“Would you take a vaccine with a 33% death rate to feel safe from a virus with a .06% death rate?”

Description	New Covid-19 vaccines contain levels of mercury that cause brain damage.
Evaluation Rational	Ivermectin “is a safe and widely available treatment for coronavirus”
Description	Public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 including face masks, vaccines, and frequent handwashing “suppress our immune systems”
Prediction	The formation of “non-neutralizing antibodies” can lead to an exaggerated immune reaction, especially when the person is confronted with the real, “wild” virus after vaccination. This so-called antibody-dependent amplification, ADE, has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats.
Description	“The CDC admitted that over 90 million people that received a polio vaccine came down with a cancer type of circumstance due to a cancer-causing agent known as SV40, also known as simian virus 40 in the polio vaccine.”
