Prediction	“It would work like a vaccine”
Interpretation	The studies into Covid-19 vaccines are too short to see if there are late effects. There were narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination, and similarly this vaccine could put millions at risk.
Evaluation Rational	The survival rate of Covid-19 without the vaccine is greater than the effectiveness of the vaccine itself.
Interpretation	“Thalidomide was a rapid approved drug introduced in 1957 to counteract nausea and insomnia in pregnant women. It was [...] withdrawn in 1962 due to malformations in newborns [...] Be very careful with what’s coming.”
Evaluation Emotional	“40 years of research, and no vaccine for HIV. At least 100 years of research and no vaccine for cancer. Ongoing research and no vaccine for the common cold. Now in less than a year, there's a vaccine for COVID-19?”
