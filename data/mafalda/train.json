I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses. Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a\"creative\" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.",
