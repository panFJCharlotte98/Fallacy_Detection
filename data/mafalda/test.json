It broke my heart. And he was flippant and dismissive. The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings POST: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. <URL> Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin. After all, 51% of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. <URL>",

I want to enjoy a shooter with team work and strategy on a large scale. I like the relatively fast paced gameplay, less down time, more engagements, smaller maps and leathal weapons make for epic flanks, as a result i feel like as a single player i can have a decent impact on a game - i just enjoy the pacing and the way combat plays out (im nervous that the infantry vehicles will fuck this up). I'll admit that PS's wider range of factions does look very attractive but at the end of the day whats the point in having all these unique and interesting guns and what not when for most of the game you arent going to be using them because your going to be on the move and then when you do its spamming suppressing fire at a hedge. Edit: to be clear i might be 100% wrong about PS i havent played it but thats just the vibe i got from the gameplay ive seen.\r POST: You havent played but are talking about it like this? Oof",
